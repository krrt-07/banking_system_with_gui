# 🌱 Grow a Garden: Banko Sheckles ng PUP (BSP)

A simple GUI-based banking system built using Python and Tkinter. This project simulates basic bank account operations such as **registration**, **login**, **deposit**, **withdrawal**, and **account management**, with persistent data storage using `JSON`.

## 💡 Features

- 🌼 **Account Registration** with full name and initial deposit  
- 🔐 **Login System** with password validation  
- 💰 **Transaction Panel** to deposit and withdraw funds  
- 🔁 **Real-time balance updates** after each transaction  
- 🔓 **Admin Access** (`DATABASE2006` / `2006`) to:  
  - View all user accounts and balances  
  - Delete user accounts  
- 🌿 Aesthetic design with a maroon and white theme (inspired by PUP)  
- 🗂️ **Data Persistence** using `accounts.json`  

---

## 🧱 Technologies Used

- Python 3.12  
- Tkinter – for the GUI  
- JSON – for saving and loading account data  
- OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) – to structure the logic using classes and encapsulation
